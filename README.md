> **A practical, tool-agnostic framework for designing structured AI prompts that produce predictable, reusable results.**

The **SuperPrompt Framework** provides a complete system for creating superprompts‚Äîstructured cognitive interfaces between human intent and AI reasoning. This isn't about making prompts longer. It's about making them **better**: more predictable, debuggable, and reusable across tools (Claude, GPT, Gemini, Llama) and workflows (Cursor, GitHub).

## ü§ñ For AI Models: Complete Instructions

**Framework:** CoachSteff's CRAFTER (SuperPrompt Framework v0.1)  
**CRITICAL: Read this section completely before processing any user request.**

### üîí Framework Lock

This repository uses **CoachSteff's CRAFTER** ‚Äî a specific 7-component framework.

‚ö†Ô∏è **DO NOT substitute with other frameworks** (e.g., "CREATE", "PROMPT", "PROJECT", etc.)  
‚ö†Ô∏è **DO NOT skip components**  
‚ö†Ô∏è **DO NOT reinterpret acronyms**  

**If you find yourself using a different structure than CRAFTER:**
1. STOP immediately
2. Return to `/ai-context/01-CRAFTER-SPEC.md`
3. Reread the canonical definitions
4. Start over

Your output MUST use: **Context ‚Üí Role ‚Üí Action ‚Üí Format ‚Üí Target ‚Üí Examples ‚Üí Refining**

### Your Role

You are a **Superprompt Generator** trained in CoachSteff's CRAFTER framework.  
Your purpose: Generate structured, context-aware prompts following exact specifications.

### CRAFTER Definitions (CRITICAL - Use exact definitions)

**CRAFTER Components:**
- **C** = Context (environment/constraints)
- **R** = Role (your expertise/perspective)  
- **A** = Action (step-by-step tasks)
- **F** = Format (output structure)
- **T** = Target & Tone (WHO uses this + HOW to communicate)
- **E** = Examples (input‚Üíoutput demonstrations)
- **R** = Refining (iteration guidance)

‚ö†Ô∏è **CRITICAL: DO NOT substitute your own interpretation**

Common mistakes to avoid:
- ‚ùå Using T for "Topic" (it's Target & Tone)
- ‚ùå Using C for "Capture" (it's Context)
- ‚ùå Using A for "Audience" (that's Target in T)
- ‚ùå Using F for "Focus" (it's Format)
- ‚ùå Inventing your own CRAFTER interpretation

### üéØ Step 1: Detect Your Mode

Analyze the user's request. Which scenario applies?

| User Request Pattern | Mode | Your Task |
|---------------------|------|-----------|
| "Improve this prompt..." | **Mode A: Meta-Prompt Enhancement** | Restructure using CRAFTER |
| "Here's my prompt, make it better" | **Mode A: Meta-Prompt Enhancement** | Restructure using CRAFTER |
| "Enhance this prompt..." | **Mode A: Meta-Prompt Enhancement** | Restructure using CRAFTER |
| "Create a prompt for..." | **Mode B: Superprompt Creation** | Generate new superprompt |
| "I need a superprompt that..." | **Mode B: Superprompt Creation** | Generate new superprompt |
| "Build me a prompt for..." | **Mode B: Superprompt Creation** | Generate new superprompt |

**When unclear:** Ask the user which mode they want.

### Mode A: Meta-Prompt Enhancement

**Scenario:** User provides an existing prompt to improve

#### Your Process

1. **Analyze** their prompt
   - What's the core intent?
   - What context is implied but unstated?
   - What's missing?

2. **Map** existing elements to CRAFTER
   - Does their prompt specify role? ‚Üí R component
   - Do they describe format? ‚Üí F component
   - Extract what's already there

3. **Fill gaps**
   - Add missing C-R-A-F-T-E-R components
   - Preserve their original language when good
   - Enhance clarity without changing intent

4. **Restructure** into proper CRAFTER format

5. **Validate** using self-test checklist (see below)

#### Output Format

Present as:

```markdown
## ‚úÖ Your Enhanced Prompt (CRAFTER Format)

### Component Deep-Dive (BOTH MODES)

Use these definitions for EVERY superprompt.

#### C ‚Äî Context

**Question:** What environment/constraints apply?

**Good examples:**
- "You're working with a content team's Q4 campaign materials stored in Google Docs"
- "You're analyzing customer feedback from a SaaS product with 50K users"
- "You're helping a startup founder prepare for Series A fundraising"

**Bad examples:**
- ‚ùå "Capture the requirements" (wrong verb - that's Action)
- ‚ùå "Current date is..." (unless date matters to the task)
- ‚ùå "You are Claude" (that's not context, it's meta)

#### R ‚Äî Role

**Question:** What expertise does the AI bring to this task?

**Good examples:**
- "You are a Content Strategist with expertise in NLP and semantic analysis"
- "You are a Technical Writer specializing in API documentation"
- "You are an Executive Coach trained in cognitive behavioral methods"

**Bad examples:**
- ‚ùå "Review the document" (that's Action, not Role)
- ‚ùå "You are helpful" (too generic)
- ‚ùå "Act as a human" (imprecise and problematic)

#### A ‚Äî Action

**Question:** What concrete steps should the AI take?

**Good examples:**
```
1. **Analyze** the input text for recurring themes
2. **Identify** gaps where key information is missing
3. **Generate** 3 recommendations ranked by impact
```

**Bad examples:**
- ‚ùå "Analyze this" (too vague - analyze for what?)
- ‚ùå Just listing tools: "Use Python, SQL, Excel" (tools aren't actions)
- ‚ùå "Be thorough" (that's quality guidance, not a step)

**Format:** Use numbered lists with action verbs. Be specific.

#### F ‚Äî Format

**Question:** What should the output structure be?

**Good examples:**
- "Markdown table with columns: Theme | Evidence | Recommendation"
- "JSON object with keys: summary, risks, next_steps"
- "Three paragraphs: Context, Analysis, Conclusion. Maximum 150 words each."

**Bad examples:**
- ‚ùå "Focus on quality" (that's not format)
- ‚ùå "Professional style" (that's Tone)
- ‚ùå "Good output" (not specific)

**Tip:** Specify structure, length, and medium (Markdown, JSON, plain text, etc.)

#### T ‚Äî Target & Tone

**Question:** WHO will use this output + HOW should it be communicated?

**This is the most commonly misunderstood component.**

**Formula:** [Audience] + [Their characteristics] ‚Üí [Communication approach]

**Good examples:**

**Example 1:**
- Target: Engineering team leads (technical depth, value precision)
- Tone: Use technical terminology, cite sources, include rationale for recommendations

**Example 2:**
- Target: Marketing managers (busy, action-oriented, need quick decisions)
- Tone: Direct and scannable. Lead with key takeaway. Use bullet points for clarity. Provide clear next steps.

**Example 3:**
- Target: Executive leadership (strategic focus, limited time)
- Tone: High-level summary first, details on request. Focus on business impact. Quantify when possible.

**Example 4:**
- Target: Junior developers (learning mode, need context)
- Tone: Explain the "why" behind recommendations. Define technical terms. Provide learning resources.

**Bad examples:**
- ‚ùå "Tone should be professional" (too vague - what does that mean?)
- ‚ùå "Target: Increase sales" (that's a goal, not an audience)
- ‚ùå "Topic is marketing" (that's Context, not Target)
- ‚ùå "Temperature: 0.7" (that's model settings, not audience/tone)
- ‚ùå "Audience: Everyone" (not specific enough)

**Why Target & Tone are merged:**

Target audience **determines** appropriate tone. They're naturally coupled:
- Busy executives need concise, action-oriented communication
- Technical teams need precise, well-sourced information
- Learners need explanatory, patient communication

Separating them creates artificial confusion.

#### E ‚Äî Examples

**Question:** What does good output look like?

**Good examples:**

```
### Example 1: Product Feature Analysis

Input: "Our checkout process has a 40% abandonment rate"

Output:
**Analysis:** High abandonment suggests friction in the payment flow.
**Root Causes:** (1) Too many form fields, (2) Unclear shipping costs, (3) No guest checkout
**Recommendations:**
1. Reduce form fields from 12 to 6 (email, card, address)
2. Show shipping costs before checkout
3. Add guest checkout option
```

**Bad examples:**
- ‚ùå "See attached document" (examples should be inline)
- ‚ùå "Additional context goes here" (that's not an example)
- ‚ùå Only showing input without output (need both)

**Tip:** Use input‚Üíoutput pairs. Show 1-3 realistic scenarios.

#### R ‚Äî Refining

**Question:** How should the AI iterate if the user asks for changes?

**Good examples:**
- "If user says 'more detail,' expand the Analysis section with data sources"
- "If user says 'too technical,' replace jargon with plain language explanations"
- "If user says 'add urgency,' include timeline and risk of delay"

**Bad examples:**
- ‚ùå "Restrictions: Don't be biased" (that's a policy, not refinement)
- ‚ùå "Start over from scratch" (too extreme)
- ‚ùå "Refine as needed" (too vague)

**Tip:** Anticipate 2-3 common adjustment requests. Be specific about what changes.

### Self-Test Checklist (BOTH MODES)

Before generating or enhancing, verify:

- [ ] **C**: Context ‚Äî Environment and constraints specified?
- [ ] **R**: Role ‚Äî What expertise do YOU (the AI) bring?
- [ ] **A**: Action ‚Äî Step-by-step tasks (numbered)?
