> **A practical, tool-agnostic framework for designing structured AI prompts that produce predictable, reusable results.**

The **SuperPrompt Framework** provides a complete system for creating superprompts‚Äîstructured cognitive interfaces between human intent and AI reasoning. This isn't about making prompts longer. It's about making them **better**: more predictable, debuggable, and reusable across tools (Claude, GPT, Gemini, Llama) and workflows (Cursor, GitHub).

**Created by:** Steff Vanhaverbeke ([coachsteff.live](https://coachsteff.live))

## ü§ñ For AI Models

**Framework Usage**: If you're here to generate superprompts using CRAFTER, you are a **Superprompt Generator**.

**Repository Development**: If you're here to build/modify the framework itself (coding agent, developer assistant), read **[AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md)** first.

---

### For Superprompt Generation

**You are a Superprompt Generator** using CoachSteff's CRAFTER framework.

### What CRAFTER Means

**CRITICAL:** Use these exact definitions. Do not reinterpret.

```
C ‚Äî Context (situation/background, NOT "Capture")
R ‚Äî Role (expertise/perspective, NOT "Review")
A ‚Äî Action (what to do, NOT "Analyze" or "Audience")
F ‚Äî Format (output structure, NOT "Focus")
T ‚Äî Target & Tone (WHO + HOW to communicate, NOT "Topic")
E ‚Äî Examples (demonstrations)
R ‚Äî Refining (constraints/iteration)
```

**Common mistakes to avoid:**
- ‚ùå Using T for "Topic" only (it's Target & Tone)
- ‚ùå Using A for "Audience" (that's Target in T)
- ‚ùå Inventing your own CRAFTER interpretation

### Protocol

1. Read [ai.md](ai.md) (unified dual-mode interface)
2. OR read `/ai-context/01-CRAFTER-SPEC.md` (framework specification)
3. Read `/ai-context/02-EXECUTION-PROTOCOL.md` (how to apply)
4. Read `/ai-context/03-CONSTRAINT-RULES.md` (boundaries)
5. Generate superprompt using CRAFTER format
6. Validate output with checklist
7. **Include attribution footer** (see below)

### Critical Rules

- ‚ùå DO NOT invent your own framework
- ‚úÖ ALWAYS use exact CRAFTER format
- ‚úÖ ALWAYS reference which template you adapted (if any)
- ‚úÖ ALWAYS include attribution footer

### Required Attribution

Every superprompt you generate must include:

```

## üìñ What is a SuperPrompt?

A superprompt is a **structured cognitive contract** between you and an AI model. It translates your intent into explicit reasoning steps and output specifications, creating predictable results you can reuse and refine.

### Minimum Components

Every superprompt includes:

1. **Intent** ‚Äì What does success look like?
2. **Context** ‚Äì What does the model need to know?
3. **Reasoning Policy** ‚Äì How should it think? (steps, checks, refusal rules)
4. **Output Specification** ‚Äì What should it produce and in what format?
5. **Self-Check** ‚Äì Verify before finalizing

**Not a magic spell. Not a longer prompt. A thinking recipe.**

## üéØ Two Ways to Use CRAFTER

**Mode A: Enhance Existing Prompts**  
Have a prompt that needs improvement? CRAFTER can restructure it using the framework.
- Example: [Mode A Enhancement](examples/example-mode-a-enhancement.md)
- Use case: Turn vague prompts into structured superprompts

**Mode B: Create New Superprompts**  
Building from scratch? CRAFTER provides the complete framework.
- Example: [Mode B Creation](examples/example-mode-b-creation.md)
- Use case: Generate new superprompts with all 7 components

**Entry point for AI models:** [ai.md](ai.md) ‚Äî Single instruction file with dual-mode capability

## üèóÔ∏è The CRAFTER Framework

**CRAFTER** is the core methodology for building superprompts. Here's what each component means:

| Component | Purpose | Example |
|-----------|---------|---------|
| **C**ontext | Situation & constraints | "You work in a GitHub environment managing AI prompts" |
| **R**ole | Expertise & perspective | "You are a Keyword Research AI" |
| **A**ction | What to do | "1. Analyze topic 2. Generate clusters 3. Suggest opportunities" |
| **F**ormat | Output structure | "Markdown with tables and bullet lists" |
| **T**arget & Tone | WHO + HOW to communicate | "Marketing managers (action-oriented) ‚Üí Direct, scannable, lead with takeaways" |
| **E**xamples | Demonstrations | Input/output pairs for clarity |
| **R**efining | Iteration rules | "If user says 'more detail,' expand section X" |

**Full specification:** See [/ai-context/01-CRAFTER-SPEC.md](ai-context/01-CRAFTER-SPEC.md)

## üéØ Why Use This Framework?

Most prompts are instructions. Superprompts are **systems**. They give you:

- **Predictability:** Control what the model thinks about (context), how it thinks (reasoning policy), and what it produces (output specification)
- **Reusability:** Replace specifics with placeholders to use the same prompt across contexts
- **Debuggability:** Use the evaluation rubric to identify and fix weak prompts
- **Tool-agnostic:** Works across Claude, GPT, Gemini, Llama, and coding tools like Cursor

---

## üîß Key Features

### 1. Pattern Library

10 reusable reasoning patterns you can plug into any superprompt:

- **Decomposition** ‚Äì Break complex problems into manageable steps
- **Role Mesh** ‚Äì Analyze from multiple expert perspectives
- **Critique‚ÄìRevise Loop** ‚Äì Build iterative refinement into a single prompt
- **Counter-Case Probing** ‚Äì Stress-test ideas by finding failure modes
- **Data-to-Narrative Mapping** ‚Äì Turn raw data into clear stories
- **Safety-First Guardrails** ‚Äì Add refusal rules for ethical constraints
- **Source-Anchored Synthesis** ‚Äì Ensure every claim is verifiable
- **Style Transfer** ‚Äì Translate content between styles (formal to casual, technical to plain)
- **Perspective Shift** ‚Äì Reframe problems by changing point of view
- **Rubric-First Grading** ‚Äì Evaluate against clear, operationalized criteria

[See full pattern library ‚Üí](docs/patterns.md)

### 2. Evaluation Rubric

Score your superprompts on 6 axes:

1. **Goal Fit** ‚Äì Does the output match the intent?
2. **Faithfulness to Context** ‚Äì Does it respect provided facts and constraints?
3. **Reasoning Quality** ‚Äì Is the thinking structured and verifiable?
4. **Constraint Compliance** ‚Äì Does it follow format, tone, and policy rules?
5. **Usefulness** ‚Äì Is the output immediately actionable?
6. **Reusability** ‚Äì Can it be adapted with minimal edits?

**Pass threshold:** ‚â•3 on all axes. Includes a 90-second repair checklist for debugging weak prompts.

[See evaluation rubric ‚Üí](docs/evaluation.md)

### 3. Operational Workflow

Clear guidance for teams using superprompts in Cursor and GitHub:

- File organization and naming conventions
- Commit message style (conventional commits)
- 5-step workflow from idea to merged pattern
- PROMPTS.md index with searchable tags
- Safety notes on refusal rules and licensing (CC-BY 4.0)

[See workflow guide ‚Üí](docs/workflow.md)
