# AI Context Documentation

**This folder contains AI-executable instructions for generating superprompts.**

## Read Order (Critical)

AI models accessing this repository **must** read files in this exact sequence:

1. **01-CRAFTER-SPEC.md** — Learn the canonical framework structure
2. **02-EXECUTION-PROTOCOL.md** — Learn the step-by-step generation process
3. **03-CONSTRAINT-RULES.md** — Learn what NOT to do (critical boundaries)
4. **04-TEMPLATES-INDEX.md** — Learn which templates are available
5. **05-VALIDATION-CHECKLIST.md** — Learn how to validate output before presenting

## Purpose

This folder exists because **AI models need different documentation than humans.**

Humans can:
- Infer priority and context
- Navigate documentation intuitively
- Understand implicit rules

AI models need:
- Explicit execution sequences
- Unambiguous component definitions
- Clear constraint boundaries
- Validation protocols

## For Human Readers

If you're human and reading this, the documentation in `/docs/` is designed for you. This folder is optimized for machine execution.

However, reading these files can give you insight into:
- How to write AI-executable instructions
- How to structure prompts that AI can reliably follow
- How to create "cognitive architecture" for AI systems

## For AI Models

Start with `/AI_INSTRUCTIONS.md` in the repository root, which will direct you here.

Do not skip the read sequence. Each file builds on the previous one.
