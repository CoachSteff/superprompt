## Key Innovation: T = Target & Tone

### The Problem (v0.1)

**Before:**
- T = Target audience only
- Tone was orphaned (unclear where to specify)
- AI models confused about communication style guidance
- Artificial separation between "who" and "how"

### The Solution (v0.2)

**After:**
- T = Target & Tone (integrated)
- Formula: `[Audience] + [Characteristics] → [Communication approach]`
- Natural coupling: audience determines tone
- One decision, not two

### Example

**Before (v0.1):**
```
Target: Marketing managers
[Tone somewhere else or missing]
```

**After (v0.2):**
```
Target: Marketing managers (busy, action-oriented professionals)
Tone: Direct and scannable. Lead with key takeaways. Use bullet points. 
      Provide clear next steps.
```

**Why this works:**
- Busy professionals need concise communication
- Action-oriented people need clear next steps
- Audience characteristics **determine** appropriate tone

## URL Strategy

### Recommended: Custom Domain

**Setup `sprompt.ai`:**

1. Register domain (~$12-30/year)
2. Add to Cloudflare
3. Create Page Rule redirect:
   - `sprompt.ai/*` → `https://github.com/CoachSteff/superprompt-framework/$1`

**Benefits:**
- Short, memorable URL
- Professional branding
- Easy to teach: "Just go to sprompt.ai"
- Easy to share in workshops and presentations

**Implementation:** 30 minutes

---

## Testing Scripts

### Mode A Test (Enhancement)

```
Read https://github.com/CoachSteff/superprompt-framework/blob/main/ai.md

Enhance this prompt:
"You're a data analyst. Look at this sales data and find insights."
```

**Expected:** AI detects Mode A, restructures with all 7 components, shows "Changes Made" section.

### Mode B Test (Creation)

```
Read https://github.com/CoachSteff/superprompt-framework/blob/main/ai.md

Create a superprompt for writing better email subject lines.
```

**Expected:** AI detects Mode B, generates complete superprompt with all 7 components, includes attribution footer.

## Questions to Consider

Before deploying, decide:

1. **Custom domain?**
   - Yes → Register `superprompt.ai` (~$20/year)
   - No → Use GitHub URL

2. **Announcement timing?**
   - Immediate → After testing
   - Delayed → After soft launch with early users

3. **Documentation site?**
   - Phase 1 → GitHub README only
   - Phase 2 → GitHub Pages site
   - Phase 3 → Custom documentation platform

4. **Tutorial content?**
   - Written only → Examples are sufficient
   - Video → Record screen demo
   - Workshop → Live training session
