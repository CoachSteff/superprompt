# Pre-Test Hardening Implementation Summary

**Date:** October 22, 2025  
**Branch:** `pre-test-hardening` ‚Üí merged to `main`  
**PR:** #2  

---

## Strategic Improvements Implemented

This hardening phase addresses vulnerabilities discovered during initial cross-model testing. Each improvement targets a specific failure mode with measurable success criteria.

---

## 1. Framework Lock (AI_INSTRUCTIONS.md)

**Problem:** Models deviated to alternative frameworks (Grok ‚Üí "PROJECT", ChatGPT ‚Üí different acronyms)

**Solution:** Cognitive firewall at entry point

### What Changed
```markdown
## üîí Framework Lock

‚ö†Ô∏è DO NOT substitute with other frameworks (e.g., "CREATE", "PROMPT", "PROJECT")
‚ö†Ô∏è DO NOT skip components
‚ö†Ô∏è DO NOT reinterpret acronyms

If you find yourself using a different structure:
1. STOP immediately
2. Return to /ai-context/01-CRAFTER-SPEC.md
3. Reread canonical definitions
4. Start over
```

**Test Criteria:**
- Model reading this should pause before generation
- Any deviation should trigger self-correction
- Grok's "PROJECT" substitution should be blocked

---

## 2. Procedural Self-Test (AI_INSTRUCTIONS.md)

**Problem:** Self-test was optional; models skipped validation

**Solution:** Convert to mandatory 4-step procedure

### What Changed
```markdown
### 4. MANDATORY: Complete Self-Test BEFORE Generation

BEFORE generating a superprompt:
1. Read /ai-context/01-CRAFTER-SPEC.md completely
2. Complete the Framework Fidelity Self-Test
3. If score < B (5/7), reread missing sections
4. ONLY THEN proceed to generation
```

**Checklist Enforcement:**
- Each component explicitly marked as NOT other interpretations
- Scoring system with consequences (F/C/B/A grades)
- Clear threshold: score below B = must reread

**Test Criteria:**
- Models should reference self-test completion
- Low scores should trigger specification rereading
- All 7 components should be verified before output

---

## 3. Positive Examples (01-CRAFTER-SPEC.md)

**Problem:** Negations ("NOT Tone") may prime unwanted associations

**Solution:** "What to do" examples alongside "what not to do"

### What Changed
```markdown
### Component Clarifications (What Each Letter MEANS)

C = Context
‚Üí "What environment are we operating in?"
‚Üí Example: "You are working with a professional coach's content library"
‚ùå NOT "Capture requirements"

T = Target audience
‚Üí "Who will use this output?"
‚Üí Example: "Marketing managers who need customer-facing copy"
‚ùå NOT "Tone should be professional" or "Topic is marketing"
```

**Test Criteria:**
- ChatGPT should see T = Target with positive example first
- Reduces likelihood of T ‚Üí Tone misinterpretation
- Each component gets constructive guidance

---

## 4. Framework Integrity Check (01-CRAFTER-SPEC.md)

**Problem:** No mechanism for models to verify their own structure compliance

**Solution:** Self-verification section with explicit non-CRAFTER examples

### What Changed
```markdown
## Framework Integrity Check

‚ö†Ô∏è Before you generate any superprompt, verify:
1. Am I using the CRAFTER structure (C-R-A-F-T-E-R)?
2. Or have I substituted a different framework?

This framework IS:
- CoachSteff's CRAFTER (Context, Role, Action, Format, Target, Examples, Refining)

This framework IS NOT:
- CREATE (Context, Role, Examples, Action, Tone, Evaluate)
- PROMPT (Problem, Role, Objective, Mechanics, Process, Tone)
- PROJECT (Problem, Role, Objective, Justification, Examples, Constraints, Tone)
```

**Test Criteria:**
- Grok should notice if it's using "PROJECT" instead
- Models should self-check before claiming compliance
- Clear differentiation from similar frameworks

---

## 5. Grok Detection Logic (ai-compatibility.md)

**Problem:** No troubleshooting path for complete framework replacement

**Solution:** Detection signs + corrective template + Tier 0 acceptance

### What Changed
```markdown
### Model replaces CRAFTER with its own system (Grok issue)

Symptoms:
- Output uses "PROJECT" or "CREATE" or another acronym
- Explicitly states it's using a "better" framework
- Ignores CRAFTER structure entirely

Solutions:
1. Paste entire contents of 01-CRAFTER-SPEC.md into chat
2. Force compliance with explicit instruction
3. Accept deviation (if useful)
4. Switch models (for compliance)
```

**Test Criteria:**
- Users know how to diagnose framework replacement
- Corrective template available for direct paste
- Tier 0 designation acknowledges some models won't comply

---

## 6. Attribution Placement Enforcement

**Problem:** Attribution sometimes buried at top/middle or omitted

**Solution:** Explicit END placement requirement across all files

### What Changed
- `AI_INSTRUCTIONS.md`: "Include this **at the END** of every superprompt"
- `01-CRAFTER-SPEC.md`: "Attribution Requirements" specifies END placement
- `ai-compatibility.md`: "Attribution must appear at the END of the output"

**Added Guidance:**
```markdown
Placement: This footer MUST appear at the END of the superprompt, 
not at the beginning or middle.
```

**Test Criteria:**
- Attribution should be last element of every output
- No more token-limit truncation
- Consistent across all model tiers

## Files Changed

| File | Lines Added | Key Improvements |
|------|-------------|------------------|
| `AI_INSTRUCTIONS.md` | +35 | Framework Lock, Procedural Self-Test |
| `ai-context/01-CRAFTER-SPEC.md` | +80 | Positive Examples, Integrity Check |
| `docs/ai-compatibility.md` | +45 | Grok Detection, Placement Rules |

## Testing Validation Plan

### Test 1: Framework Fidelity
**Prompt:** "Create a superprompt using CRAFTER for teachers designing lesson plans"

**Success Metrics:**
- [ ] Model completes self-test before generation
- [ ] All 7 components present (C-R-A-F-T-E-R)
- [ ] T = Target audience (NOT Tone/Topic)
- [ ] Attribution at END

**Models to test:** All tiers (Gemini, ChatGPT, Perplexity, Grok, Claude)

---

### Test 2: Framework Lock Effectiveness
**Prompt:** "Use CRAFTER to build a superprompt for project managers"

**Success Metrics:**
- [ ] No substitution of alternative frameworks
- [ ] If deviation occurs, model self-corrects
- [ ] Grok specifically: Does it notice PROJECT ‚â† CRAFTER?

**Expected behavior:**
- Tier 1 models: Perfect compliance
- Tier 2 models: Self-correction if drifting
- Tier 0 models: May still deviate (documented)

---

### Test 3: Positive Example Impact
**Prompt:** "Generate superprompt with CRAFTER for sales teams"

**Success Metrics:**
- [ ] ChatGPT: Does NOT interpret T as Tone
- [ ] All models: Use positive examples as guide
- [ ] Components match question-based definitions

**Hypothesis:** Positive framing reduces T=Tone error rate

---

### Test 4: Attribution Compliance
**Prompt:** Any superprompt generation request

**Success Metrics:**
- [ ] Attribution present in 100% of outputs
- [ ] Attribution at END (not buried/top)
- [ ] Correct format with framework name + license

**Pass threshold:** 5/5 models place attribution correctly

---

### Test 5: Self-Test Execution
**Prompt:** "Before creating the superprompt, show me your Framework Fidelity Self-Test score"

**Success Metrics:**
- [ ] Model completes checklist
- [ ] Shows score (X/7) and grade (F/C/B/A)
- [ ] If score < B, rerereads specification
- [ ] Proceeds only after passing threshold

**This validates:** Procedural enforcement works

---

## Comparison: Before vs. After

| Issue | Before Hardening | After Hardening |
|-------|-----------------|-----------------|
| T misinterpretation | "NOT Tone" ‚Üí still interpreted as Tone | Positive example: "Who will use this?" |
| Framework replacement | No detection, no guidance | Detection signs + corrective template |
| Self-test | Optional, often skipped | Mandatory 4-step procedure |
| Attribution | Sometimes missing/buried | Required at END, three-file enforcement |
| Deviation awareness | Models unaware they're off-spec | Multiple checkpoints + self-verification |

---

## Expected Outcomes

**Tier 1 Models (Perplexity, Claude+Projects):**
- Perfect compliance (7/7 components)
- Self-test completion before generation
- Attribution at END
- No framework drift

**Tier 2 Models (ChatGPT, Claude):**
- High compliance (6-7/7 components)
- Occasional self-correction
- Attribution mostly correct
- Minor deviations caught early

**Tier 3 Models (Gemini, free models):**
- Basic compliance (4-5/7 components)
- May need prompted self-test
- Attribution with reminder
- Template-style outputs acceptable

**Tier 0 Models (Grok):**
- May still resist framework
- Detection logic helps users diagnose
- Alternative frameworks documented as expected
- Users know when to switch models

---

## Success Criteria Summary

**This hardening is successful if:**

1. ‚úÖ ChatGPT stops interpreting T as "Tone" (>80% accuracy)
2. ‚úÖ Models complete self-test before generation (measurable via test prompts)
3. ‚úÖ Grok's framework replacement is detected and documented
4. ‚úÖ Attribution appears at END in 100% of compliant outputs
5. ‚úÖ Framework Lock prevents accidental drift to CREATE/PROMPT/PROJECT

**Next step:** Execute cross-model testing with hardened framework to validate improvements.
