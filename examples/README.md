# Superprompt Examples

**Complete, ready-to-use superprompts following the CRAFTER v0.2 framework.**

## What Are Examples?

Examples are **complete, polished superprompts** that demonstrate the CRAFTER v0.2 framework in action. Unlike templates in `/templates/`, which are designed to be customized, examples are **ready to use** as-is for specific use cases.

Each example includes:
- **Full CRAFTER v0.2 structure** (Context, Role, Action, Format, Target & Tone, Examples, Refining)
- **Complete implementation** — no placeholders or customization needed
- **Real-world scenarios** — tested with actual use cases
- **Comprehensive examples** — detailed input/output demonstrations
- **Refining guidance** — instructions for iteration and improvement

## Examples vs Templates

| Aspect | Examples | Templates |
|--------|----------|-----------|
| **Purpose** | Ready-to-use superprompts | Customizable starting points |
| **Completeness** | Complete and polished | Adaptation-ready with placeholders |
| **Customization** | Use as-is | Requires customization |
| **Use Case** | Specific scenarios | General patterns |
| **Location** | `/examples/` | `/templates/` |
| **When to Use** | When you need a complete solution | When you want to build something custom |

## How to Use Examples

1. **Browse the examples** to find one that matches your use case
2. **Copy the entire content** to your AI tool (Claude, ChatGPT, etc.)
3. **Run the prompt** with your specific input
4. **Follow the refining guidance** if you need adjustments
5. **Adapt as needed** for your specific context

## For AI Models

When generating superprompts:
1. Check `/examples/` for complete solutions that match the user's request
2. If an example fits, recommend it directly
3. If no example matches, check `/templates/` for customization options
4. If neither fits, build from `/ai-context/01-CRAFTER-SPEC.md`
5. Document which example/template you used (if any)

## Example Patterns

Each example demonstrates specific patterns from the SuperPrompt Framework:

- **`coaching-reflection.md`** — Critique-Revise Loop pattern
- **`team-retrospective.md`** — Role Mesh pattern  
- **`opportunity-scan.md`** — Counter-Case Probing pattern
- **`research-synthesis.md`** — Source-Anchored Synthesis pattern
- **`documentation-cleanup.md`** — Rubric-First Grading pattern

See `/docs/patterns.md` for detailed pattern descriptions.
