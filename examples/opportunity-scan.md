# Example 3: Entrepreneurial Opportunity Scan

**Why this works:** Uses Counter-Case Probing to stress-test an idea before investing time. The structured output makes it easy to decide "pursue" or "pass."

**Quick customization levers:**
1. Change the opportunity type (product, service, partnership, market entry)
2. Adjust evaluation criteria (market size, personal fit, risk tolerance)
3. Modify decision timeline (quick scan vs. deep dive)

Title: Entrepreneurial Opportunity Scan

ROLE & TONE
You are a pragmatic business advisor who has seen hundreds of startups. Write with directness and honesty. Don't sugarcoat risks, but also recognize genuine upside.

INTENT
Help me evaluate whether to pursue a new business opportunity by surfacing both the case for it and the strongest counter-cases. Success means: (1) a clear "pursue" or "pass" recommendation, (2) at least 3 specific scenarios where this opportunity would fail, (3) a concrete next step if I decide to pursue it.

CONTEXT
- Opportunity: Launch a micro-SaaS product that helps freelance coaches track client progress
- Market: Freelance coaches (solopreneurs, mostly non-technical)
- My background: I'm a coach with 10 years of experience; I'm technical enough to build an MVP but not a skilled developer
- Existing solutions: General CRM tools (too complex), spreadsheets (manual), expensive coaching platforms (overkill)
- My constraints: 10 hours/week for 3 months to validate this idea; €5,000 budget
- My goal: Replace 20% of my coaching income with product revenue within 18 months

REASONING POLICY
1. Start by identifying the strongest case for this opportunity: What's the real problem it solves? Who would pay for it?
2. Use Counter-Case Probing: Identify 3 scenarios where this opportunity would fail or lead to poor outcomes (be specific and non-obvious)
3. For each counter-case, explain why the failure would occur and what it reveals about hidden assumptions
4. Based on the counter-cases, decide: Is this a "pursue" or "pass"?
5. If "pursue," provide one concrete next step I can take this week to validate the idea
6. If "pass," suggest what would need to change for this to become viable
7. Refuse to be overly optimistic or overly pessimistic—stay evidence-based

OUTPUT
Produce an opportunity evaluation in markdown format with these sections:

1. **The Case For** (3–5 sentences: what's the real problem and who would pay?)
2. **Counter-Case 1** (scenario where this fails + why + hidden assumption)
3. **Counter-Case 2** (scenario where this fails + why + hidden assumption)
4. **Counter-Case 3** (scenario where this fails + why + hidden assumption)
5. **Decision** (Pursue or Pass, with reasoning)
6. **Next Step** (if Pursue: one action this week) OR **What Would Need to Change** (if Pass)

SELF-CHECK
Before finalizing:
- Are the counter-cases specific and surprising (not generic risks like "lack of funding")?
- Does the decision follow logically from the counter-cases?
- Is the next step concrete enough to schedule on my calendar?
```

**Example Output Preview:**

## Opportunity Evaluation: Micro-SaaS for Freelance Coaches

### The Case For
Freelance coaches track client progress manually (spreadsheets, notes, memory), which is time-consuming and makes it hard to demonstrate impact. They're willing to pay for simple tools that save time, but existing CRMs are overkill. There's a gap for a lightweight, coach-specific tool that tracks session notes, client goals, and progress over time. Target: 500 paying customers at €15/month = €90,000/year.

---

### Counter-Case 1: Coaches Don't See This as a Priority
**Scenario:** You build the MVP, but when you talk to coaches, they say "nice to have" and don't convert to paying customers.

**Why this happens:** Coaches prioritize getting more clients over managing existing ones. Progress tracking feels like admin work, not revenue-generating activity. If they're already using a system (even if it's clunky), the switching cost is high.

**Hidden assumption:** You're assuming coaches value optimization, but they may actually value client acquisition more. This reveals that the value proposition might not align with their real priorities.

---

### Counter-Case 2: You Build It, But No One Finds It
**Scenario:** The product exists, but you struggle to reach your target audience. Freelance coaches don't hang out in one place, and your marketing budget is too small to reach them at scale.

**Why this happens:** Freelance coaches are a fragmented market. Without a distribution channel (a community, a partnership, an existing audience), you can't reach enough people to validate product-market fit in 3 months.

**Hidden assumption:** You're assuming "build it and they will come," but distribution is often harder than product development. This reveals that you may not have a go-to-market strategy beyond "post on LinkedIn."

---

### Counter-Case 3: You Build It, But You Hate Maintaining It
**Scenario:** You launch the MVP, get 50 users, but realize you hate being a product owner. Customer support, bug fixes, and feature requests drain your energy and take you away from coaching (which you love).

**Why this happens:** You're a coach first, not a product builder. The skills required to maintain a SaaS product (technical support, marketing, sales) are different from coaching, and you may not enjoy them.

**Hidden assumption:** You're assuming "product revenue" is inherently more appealing than "coaching revenue," but it may just be a different kind of work you don't actually want to do. This reveals a potential misalignment between the opportunity and your deeper motivations.

---

### Decision: **PASS (for now)**

**Reasoning:**  
Counter-Cases 2 and 3 are deal-breakers. You don't have a clear distribution channel (which means you'll struggle to reach 500 coaches in 18 months), and there's a real risk you'll build something you don't enjoy maintaining. The idea isn't bad, but it's not viable given your current constraints (time, budget, skillset).

---

### What Would Need to Change

For this opportunity to become viable, you'd need:

1. **A distribution partner:** Find an existing community or platform where coaches already gather (e.g., a coaching association, a popular coaching podcast) and negotiate a partnership or affiliate deal.

2. **A co-founder:** Partner with someone who loves product work and has complementary skills (marketing, technical support). This would solve the "you hate maintaining it" problem.

3. **Proof of demand:** Before building anything, pre-sell the product to 20 coaches. If you can't sell a promise, you won't be able to sell a product.

If all three of these change, revisit this opportunity. Until then, focus on your coaching business.
