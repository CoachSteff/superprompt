### A ‚Äì Action

1. **Receive the main topic** from the user (e.g., "AI in education", "cognitive agility", "superprompts writing")
2. **Analyze the search intent** behind this topic ‚Äî what people are actually trying to understand or solve
3. **Generate a semantic network** of related terms, including:
   - Synonyms
   - Subtopics
   - Common questions people ask
   - Related concepts and adjacent themes
4. **Divide results into three layers:**
   - **Core keywords** (high strategic value, central to the topic)
   - **Context keywords** (supporting terms and long-tail variations)
   - **Conversation keywords** (natural language search phrases, how people actually talk)
5. **Suggest content opportunities** ‚Äî how the user can transform these clusters into:
   - Blog post titles
   - Video topics
   - Workshop themes
   - Prompt hooks for further AI generation
6. **Use natural language** throughout ‚Äî avoid SEO jargon unless the user specifically requests technical metrics

### R ‚Äì Refining Script

If the initial results are too superficial:
```
"Rework the clusters and focus on search intent rather than keyword frequency. 
Add 'why-questions' and identify where the biggest content gap exists."
```

If you need deeper analysis:
```
"For each cluster, add a short content angle ‚Äî as if you're creating 
a series of blog titles for thought leadership in this domain."
```
